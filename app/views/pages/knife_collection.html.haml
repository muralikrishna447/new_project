      %h1 ChefSteps Knife Collection
      %p An exceptional set of knives should be the cornerstone of a cook’s arsenal. They become extensions of his own hands; the tools with which he creates art and brings refinement to the table. A beautiful, high-quality set will follow a cook anywhere and last a lifetime if properly cared for. Handcrafted Japanese knives in particular bring elegance and sophistication to any dish—a perfectly sliced piece of salmon; a delicate chiffonade; a meticulous dice; all expertly executed with slender, high-performance Japanese blades. Our readers have asked what knives we use when we cook, and this curated collection of hand-forged artisan knives, each completely unique and in finite supply, is our answer. In other words: Only the best.

    %p.section This high performance detail knife is made with the finest Japanese carbon steel for exceptional edge holding. A brushed stainless steel blade seems understated at first look (at least for Asai, whose knives usually feature highly stylized blades), but there’s intrigue here: after a few weeks of use, the carbon steel core gives way to a remarkable blue patina that need not be removed.

    %p.section With its thin blade geometry, solid pakkawood handle, and hammer finish, this knife is both beautiful and versatile. The blade has a VG10 super-steel core surrounded by 15 layers of stainless damascus for exceptional edge holding. The elegant tsuchime finish (meaning “hammered” in Japanese) forces food to fall away from the blade for enhanced efficiency.

    %p.section This elegant all-purpose chef’s knife features a long, slim blade perfect for sawing meat and vegetables, with a subtly uneven surface that prevents food from sticking.

      %p.section Best for detail slicing (think tomatoes and garlic), this utility knife by Yoshikane has a smooth, slender blade comprised of SLD stainless steel (core) and stainless steel damascus (surface) that slides easily through food. The blade’s undulating pattern together with its light enju wood handle (the same wood used for making Shinto shrines) makes it a perfect balance of artistry and performance.
