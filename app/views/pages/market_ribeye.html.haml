      %p Tell your family, your friends, your neighbors, and that guy on the sidewalk—you're about to throw a beef party of epic, earth-shattering proportions. You, good sir or madam, are about to be the proud owner of a six-pound cut of rib-eye roast—a tender, sliceable piece of meat that'll easily feed a party of eight hungry lumberjacks—or your husband and kids, if you prefer. This beef is 100% grass-fed, free-range, pasture-raised, and certified tender-and-flavorful-as-all-get-out. What do all those things mean, exactly? Read on for more details, including a three-step process for cooking that thing to perfection. Then click the buy button, and we'll send you a vacuum-packed six-pound roast (no shipping charge), ready to drop into a sous vide water bath as soon as it arrives at your doorstep. The only catch? We've only got twenty cuts in stock, so order quickly! 
      
      %h2 How do I cook it?
      %p You'll receive your ribeye roast carefully vacuum-packed and ready to cook sous vide. Follow the steps below to cook it to perfection.

          %cs-image(url="'https://d3awvtnmmsvyot.cloudfront.net/api/file/7WJZltrWQraASpT5uInY'" aspect="1:1")
          .step-description Preheat your water bath to 136 °F / 58 °C for medium-rare. For other temperatures, see below. Cook for six hours.

          %cs-image(url="'https://d3awvtnmmsvyot.cloudfront.net/api/file/BIbM0ZOrSmiEc9yqH9rv'" aspect="1:1")
          .step-description After six hours or so (you can cook it for over fourteen hours and it won't be overdone), remove the roast from the bath, and cut open the bag. Dry the meat off with a paper towel and season it with your favorite rub. We like a combination of equal parts salt, pepper, and finely-chopped rosemary.

          %cs-image(url="'https://d3awvtnmmsvyot.cloudfront.net/api/file/F7ZYItJoS92Ckwq4dKYU'" aspect="1:1")
          .step-description Just before serving, preheat your oven to 392 °F / 200 °C. Roast the beef for 10–15 mins to develop a nice brown crust. Slice, and serve.

      %h2 What's the difference between regular beef and grass-fed beef?
      %p Grass-fed beef is just as tender and juicy as grain-fed beef, but it has a more robust, clean, beefy flavor. That's because the cows spend their whole lives roaming around, eating what they want—delicious, delicious grass. Though grain-fed beef can also be a sustainable and delicious option, grain is typically fed to cows to fatten them up, ensuring super-tender beef. In this case, the old adage is true: You are what you eat. Grain-fed beef, while certainly tender and fatty, tends to have less flavor, while grass-fed beef (and this beef in particular) is packed with natural, earthy flavor. 

      %p And though grass-fed beef once had a reputation for being tougher, that's a belief that is not necessarily accurate today, and definitely does not apply to New Zealand grass-fed black angus beef. According to our New Zealand suppliers, "this belief probably originated in the early days of the resurgence of grass-fed beef. Many American farmers hadn’t yet re-learned the proper breeds, pasturing methods, and other information necessary to produce consistently tender beef.
 
      %p "However, a 2010 comparison study by the University of Arizona actually discovered that grass-fed beef they tested had comparable tenderness to grain-fed: “…comparing shear force values as a measure of tenderness, it was surprising to find that steaks from thegrass-fed were as tender as the steaks from the grain-fed cattle” (John Marchello, 2010)."

      %h2 I like local products. Why should I buy beef from New Zealand?
      %p There are two primary reasons New Zealand's beef is so high-quality:
      %ol
        %li 
          :markdown 
            The genetics of the cattle. [Read more](http://nzgrassfedbeef.com/why-black-angus-beef-special) about why 100% New Zealand certified black angus beef tastes great, and is sustainable and healthy.
        %li How the cattle are raised. In New Zealand, there's a co-op of thousands of farmers called Silver Fern Farms. Silver Fern cows are pasture-raised, 100% grass-fed, free-range cattle. This means the meat will be flavorful, consistent, and lean. New Zealand farmers have been raising free-range, grass-fed cows for well over a century—generations of knowledge and expertise shows in the quality of the meat. 

      %h2 Why should I cook this meat sous vide?
      %p You can cook this beef however you darn well please, but we find that sous vide is the easiest, most convenient way to get consistent results. With sous vide, you can take the meat right out of the box, put it into the water bath, and just wait until you're ready to eat it, without worrying about over- or under-cooking. When it's time for dinner, just throw it in the oven for a quick roast, slice, and serve. 

      %h2 What is a ribeye roast? Why should I try one?
      %p We've cut these gorgeous ribeye roasts from between the 7th and 8th and 12th and 13th ribs of the cow. What does that mean? It means they're tender as all get out, and perfect for gentle cooking in a sous vide bath. 

      %p Why is this meat tender? We'll explain: Cows spend much of their lifetime chewing and walking, so their cheeks, shanks, chucks, and rumps develop a lot of tough collagen—these are the delicious tough cuts that we cook sloooowly in a sous vide bath, an oven, or a smoker to melt the collagen and produce a succulent, fall-off-the-bone-style meat. The muscles in the middle of the cow's back, however, don't do much work at all—that's where you find tender, juicy cuts like filet mignons, NY strip steaks, and ribeye roasts. These cuts require much shorter cook times, and have a traditional steaky texture.

      %p A great way to memorize which muscles are tough and which are tender is to remember that, beginning with the center of the cow's back, and moving down and outwards along its body from there, the muscles go from most tender to most tough, as we illustrate below.

      %cs-image(url="'https://d3awvtnmmsvyot.cloudfront.net/api/file/vK8MgA4PSICi3BLLeB5R'")

      %p What do we like about ribeye roasts in particular? First, they're tender and flavorful. Second, they're great for serving a crowd. You can cook one big hunk of meat all at once, sprinkle it with rub, and finish it off in the oven for a six- to eight-person feast you can carve up right at the table. Sounds like you're about to be a hero, doesn't it?
