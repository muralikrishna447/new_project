          %cs-image(url="'https://d3awvtnmmsvyot.cloudfront.net/api/file/7WJZltrWQraASpT5uInY'" aspect="1:1")
          .step-description Preheat your water bath to 136 °F / 58 °C for medium-rare. Cook for 6 hrs.

          %cs-image(url="'https://d3awvtnmmsvyot.cloudfront.net/api/file/BIbM0ZOrSmiEc9yqH9rv'" aspect="1:1")
          .step-description After about 6 hrs (or up to 14), remove the roast from the bath and cut open the bag. Pat dry and season with your favorite rub. We use equal parts salt, pepper, and chopped rosemary.
        .step
          %cs-image(url="'https://d3awvtnmmsvyot.cloudfront.net/api/file/F7ZYItJoS92Ckwq4dKYU'" aspect="1:1")
          .step-description Just before serving, preheat your oven to 392 °F / 200 °C. Roast the beef for 10–15 mins to develop a nice brown crust. Slice, and serve.

      %h2 What's the difference between regular beef and grass-fed beef?
      %p Grass-fed beef has a more robust, clean, beefy flavor. That’s because the cows spend their whole lives roaming around eating greens, which keep them lean and healthy. Most beef is grain-fed, because grain will fatten up the cow and make the meat more tender. Grain-fed beef, while certainly tender and fatty, tends to have less flavor, while grass-fed beef (and this beef in particular) is packed with natural, earthy flavor.

      %h2 Why is New Zealand beef so good?
      %p There are two primary reasons New Zealand's beef is so high-quality:
      %ol
        %li
          :markdown
            The genetics of the cattle. [Read more](http://nzgrassfedbeef.com/why-black-angus-beef-special) about why 100% New Zealand certified black angus beef tastes great, and is sustainable and healthy.
        %li How the cattle are raised. These cows are pasture-raised, 100% grass-fed, free-range cattle. This means the meat will be flavorful, consistent, and lean. New Zealand farmers have been raising free-range, grass-fed cows for well over a century—generations of knowledge and expertise shows in the quality of the meat.

      %h2 Why should I cook it sous vide?
      %p Sous vide is the easiest, most convenient way to get consistent results. Just take the meat right out of the box, put it into the water bath, and wait until you're ready to eat it. When it's time for dinner, just throw it in the oven for a quick roast, slice, and serve.

      %h2 What is a ribeye roast?
      %p Ribeye roast is a tender cut from between the 7th and 8th and 12th and 13th ribs of the cow. What do we like about ribeye roasts in particular? They're great for serving a crowd. You can cook one big hunk of meat all at once, sprinkle it with rub, and finish it off in the oven for a six- to eight-person feast you can carve up right at the table. Sounds like you're about to be a hero, doesn't it?
