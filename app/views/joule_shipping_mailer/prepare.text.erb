Get Ready, Cause Here Comes Joule!

We could not be more excited to announce that the first Joules have officially shipped! Huzzah!

Important things:

We’re sending them to you as fast as we can, in the order in which they were purchased.
The first Joules are on their way right now, with hundreds more catching overseas flights each day. We will be working hard to unite every Joule with its preorder owner over the next several weeks.

We will send you a tracking number as soon as your Joule ships. Please be on the lookout for a shipping confirmation email from us.

If you haven’t already, download the app for iOS (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/joule-sous-vide-by-chefsteps/id970115018?mt=8) or Google Play (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chefsteps.circulator&hl=en) and start getting pumped about what you’ll cook!

The wait is almost over! We know you are going to love cooking with Joule.
