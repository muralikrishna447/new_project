At Long Last, Here Comes Joule!

We’re thrilled to announce that the first Joules have officially shipped! Huzzah! We truly appreciate your patience, and we’re confident that cooking with Joule will be worth the wait.

Important things:

We’re sending Joules as fast as we can, in the order in which they were purchased. The first ones are on their way right now, with hundreds more catching overseas flights each day. We are working hard to unite every Joule with its preorder owner over the next several weeks.

We will send you a tracking number as soon as your Joule ships. Please be on the lookout for a shipping confirmation email from us.

If you haven’t already, download the app for iOS (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/joule-sous-vide-by-chefsteps/id970115018?mt=8) or Android (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chefsteps.circulator&hl=en) and start getting pumped about what you’ll cook!

Thank you again for ordering Joule. We can’t wait for you to get cooking.
