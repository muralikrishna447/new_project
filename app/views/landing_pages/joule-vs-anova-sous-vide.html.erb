        <h2 class="orange">Joule’s small, app-controlled design allows for more cooking space…</h2>
        <p>
          Joule is the only sous vide machine completely controlled via an app on your smartphone or tablet. Why?
          Analog features get in the way of design, performance, and power. There are no bulky display screens
          and no clunky buttons. It’s not too tall, it’s not too wide, and it doesn’t have any large protrusions—all
          thanks to the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Removal of analog controls also allows for Joule’s superior water-volume capacity and water-level range.
          Without buttons and screens, there’s plenty of room for Joule to accommodate much more water. You can
          cook in as little as 1.5 inches of water or as much as 8 inches. Joule’s motor is so powerful, it can
          maintain the temperature of more than 10 gallons of water—double what the other guys can handle. That
          means you can perfect juicy chicken for two one night, and to-die-for perfect steak for 20 the next.

        <p>
          Not only is Joule capable of bigger cooks, but it has 1100 watts of water-heating power, making it
          37 percent more powerful than Anova. Whether you just want to get dinner on the table, or you’re
          excited to start cooking 24-hour ribs, Joule heats up water more efficiently. If time is money, you
          just saved enough for a trip to the butcher.

        <h2 class="orange">...and better storage.</h2>
        <p>
          Joule is designed to be as sleek and storable as possible. If you leave it out in a pot or on a shelf, it becomes an aesthetically pleasing conversation starter. If you want to put Joule away, it easily fits in a shallow drawer or tight vertical space in a cabinet. Joule’s minimal design means it’s not at all cumbersome to handle, yet it still delivers the highest wattage.

        <h2 class="orange">Joule’s magnetic bottom and water-resistant design ensures worry-free cooking.</h2>
        <p>
          There will be times when you leave your sous vide plugged in and circulating while you go about your
          day. Sous vide machines literally mix water and electricity, so design is critical. That’s why we gave
          Joule a magnetic bottom and made it water-resistant. The magnet keeps Joule firmly stuck to the bottom
          of your stainless steel or cast iron pot—so it would be pretty difficult for even the most frisky cat
          to knock Joule over. Water-resistance? Well that’s just common sense. Joule is the only water-resistant
          sous vide machine available today. Let that sink in. If it does get knocked over or dropped into water,
          it’s no big deal—the machine will simply turn off and notify you through the app. If a machine with
          display screens and buttons get knocked over into a pot of water, it may short-circuit and cease to
          operate again.

        <p>
          While the other guys can only handle 5 gallons, Joule can cook with more than 10 gallons of water. Just
          use our Big Clamp to attach Joule to your favorite cooler, Cambro, or even a farmhouse sink, and you’re
          in business. You know what that means? In one easy, hands-free cook, you can make multiple racks of ribs.
          Burgers for 50. Potato salad for a small army. A entire suckling pig. Enough marinated chicken to last
          all summer—and with a quick finish on the grill, you will be so happy you did. The coolest part? You
          don’t need a kitchen. Anywhere there’s a plug, you can cook with Joule. You know you’ve always wanted
          a portable outdoor kitchen.
