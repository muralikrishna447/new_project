        ChefSteps is a totally new approach to learning the art *and* science
        of cooking. Taught by a world-renowned team, you will master techniques
        of traditional and modernist cooking through practical, hands-on
        demonstrations with detailed step-by-step explanations. And unlike at
        other culinary schools, you will learn the why's behind the how's from
        experts who bring the science of cooking to life in a compelling and
        practical way.  Whether you're a professional chef, a culinary student,
        or a cooking enthusiast, if you're also a curious cook, then ChefSteps
        is for you.  The classes at ChefSteps are challenging. They teach you
        what we learned cooking with many of the world's best chefs,
        collaborating with renowned food scientists, launching three acclaimed
        experimental kitchens, and our personal experience teaching hundreds of
        students and faculty at prestigious culinary schools.  But your hard
        work will pay off. The skills you master, the intuition you develop,
        and the fresh perspective on cooking you gain will give you greater
        freedom to innovate and express your creative ideas with confidence in
        the kitchen.  ChefSteps courses are free to learn. Sign up below and
        we'll let you know when the Fall class is starting.
