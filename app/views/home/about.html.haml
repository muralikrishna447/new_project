          Whenever we cook we become practical chemists, drawing on the accumulated knowledge of generations, and transforming what the Earth offers us into more concentrated forms of pleasure and nourishment.

          %strong Chefsteps exists to inspire creativity and encourage expertise in the kitchen.
          Drawing on our years of combined culinary experience and expertise, we offer hands-on online classes about food and cooking that are both informative and entertaining.  Wed don't tell you how to sharpen your knife, break down a halibut, or make macarons from scratch, we show you.  In addition, we're building a living, breathing gallery of free-to-learn techniques, recipes, tools, and ideas developed by our award-winning culinary team.  Whether you're a home cook, a professional chef, or just love watching cooks work, there's something here to discover.

          %strong Cooking is an ancient art and science, an accumulated body of knowledge passed down through generations, which we modify every day.
          At ChefSteps, we're recording the evolution in real time: Our classes, recipes, techniques, and videos give you the foundational knowledge and inspiration you need to build on the traditions and discoveries of others, and to begin to break the rules to create your own recipes and techniques.  Here, we will all grow and learn from each other's triumphs and failures, as we shape new culinary traditions for the next generation of cooks.

        %h2 How to use this site
        %p Frankly, we think you should use this site in any way you please, but here are some things you might want to know:

            %strong All of our recipes are measured in weight, rather than volume.
            We very firmly believe that weighing ingredients makes cooking easier, faster, and more fun, and we encourage you to try it.  (Seriously, it will change your life!)  But until you're ready to invest in a scale ([they're only $20]), we built a conversion tool for you.
          %p
            %strong Some of our recipes call for unfamiliar ingredients.
            We come from professional cooking backgrounds, so we're used to adding a little guar gum, xanthan, and soy lecithin to our recipes from time to time.  (And though these ingredients may sounds like chemicals, they're actually all derived from natural sources.)  Part of our mission here at ChefSteps is to make the unfamiliar familiar.  Thus, we'll show you where to buy anything you can't find at your local grocery store, and we'll also explain how and why different ingredients work.  And if you need help finding solutions or substitutions, just ask!
