Hi *|NAME|*!

Thanks for purchasing Joule! We can’t wait for you to get cooking.

Your Joule will ship in approximately 2—3 weeks. When your order does ship you will receive an email with your tracking number.

If you have questions, comments, or concerns at any point between now and when Joule arrives on your doorstep, check out the FAQ (https://support.chefsteps.com/hc/en-us), or  submit a request (https://support.chefsteps.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). We'll be happy to help.

In the meantime, we hope you'll explore the recipes and classes on chefsteps.com. Thanks so much again, and happy cooking!
