        %h2 ChefSteps Core Values
        %p Sure, every startup's got core values. They're idealistic and may seem unattainable, but they're absolutely essential in creating a shared vision that everyone can get behind. And we work on them every day at ChefSteps.

        %h3 Empower Cooks
        %p Show people how something works instead of telling them it works. Focus on delivering guidance, rather than answers, and together we'll empower a generation of cooks who are hungry to learn more.

        %h3 Ship on Quality
        %p Knowing when something is good enough is different from knowing when it is great, and knowing when it is great is different from waiting until it is perfect. Quality, yes, but please, ship.

        %h3 Over-Communicate
        %p Communicate openly. Ask lots of questions. Listen to your peers, interject your opinion, and have the courage and the curiosity to find out more about what people around you are working on.

        %h3 Be Smart and Execute
        %p Do what you think is effective. Not knowing is fine: frame an experiment, hypothesize, synthesize, learn, and move on.
      .span4.well.fixed
        %h3 Stay Hungry
        %p Leave work every day having learned something new. Someone is always doing something that you don't yet know how to do, and taking the initiative to learn about it will earn respect.

        %h3 Do What You Love

          %h3 Senior Frontend Developer (AngularJS)
          %p.section We are looking for an experienced developer with a passion for frontend work. You have built complex web apps using AngularJS or another modern Javascript framework. You wouldn't dream of writing jQuery spaghetti in 2015. You create structured, modular CSS. You play nicely with designers and care about implementing pixel-perfect, responsive, jank-free interfaces - and you can send us the URLs to prove it. Bonus points if you've also built native-wrapped HTML5 apps using Cordova. You might be the right fit if you love food, are self-directed, enjoy refactoring, and are experienced enough to know how and when to ship.

          %p.section We are looking for an engineer with demonstrable experience building high-performance, high-reliability web services. You are able to architect a system involving heterogeneous clients and complex asynchronous workers; you should be able to thoughtfully explain the tradeoffs of your architecture. You have deep knowledge of multiple NoSQL databases. You have experience with internet-of-things projects at least from the software side. You write elegant, reusable, well tested code and can strike the right balance between writing perfect code and shipping it rapidly and iteratively. You might be the right fit if you are passionate about developing elegant, future-proofed APIs and know how to both prototype rapidly and then turn prototypes into production-ready code.

          %h3 Senior Electrical Engineer
          %p.section At ChefSteps we’re frustrated by the lack of innovation in the kitchen. Even the most basic appliances haven't changed in any meaningful way in years, and great ideas are being overlooked. So we're jumping in to create appliances that enthusiastic cooks want. We're looking for an experienced electrical engineer with a proven track record of designing and shipping high-volume consumer electronics products.. In this role you will work to conceive, design, evaluate, and produce new types of kitchen tools. You’ll also be expected to have experience working with contract manufactures to produce prototype and production hardware.

          %h3 Senior Mechanical Engineer
          %p.section We are looking for Mechanical Engineers who are interested in the entire product building experience from prototype to production.  You should have 10 years of experience, and hopefully have tools of your own at home.  You should love actually building what you design, taking it from model on the screen to model in your hand. You won't just be stuck in a 'Mech-E' box, you'll participate in all levels of the products.  You might be the right fit if you love food, are self-directed, and are experienced enough to know when and how to ship things.
