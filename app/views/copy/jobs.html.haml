        %h2 Every cook, cooking smarter.

            %h2 ChefSteps Core Values
            %p Sure, every startup's got core values. They're idealistic and may seem unattainable, but they're absolutely essential in creating a shared vision that everyone can get behind. And we work on them everyday at ChefSteps.

            %h3 Empower Cooks
            %p Show people how something works instead of telling them it works. Focus on delivering guidance, rather than answers, and together we'll empower a generation of cooks who are hungry to learn more

            %h3 Ship on Quality
            %p Knowing when something is good enough is different from knowing when it is great, and knowing when it is great is different from waiting until it is perfect. Quality, yes, but please, ship.

            %h3 Over-communicate
            %p Communicate openly. Ask lots of questions. Listen to your peers, interject your opinion, and have the courage and the curiosity to find out more about what people around you are working on.
          .span4.well
            %h3 Be Smart and Execute
            %p Do what you think is effective. Not knowing is fine: frame an experiment, hypothesize, synthesize, learn, and move on.

            %h3 Stay Hungry
            %p Leave work every day having learned something new. Someone is always doing something that you don't yet know how to do, and taking the initiative to learn about it will earn respect.
          .span4.well
            %h3 Do What You Love
            %p Think long-term about what you love to do, and that will guide you to where the most value is in the short-term. Do what needs to get done so you can continue doing what you love.
          .span4.well
            %h3 Win Together
            %p We succeed and fail as a team. Donâ€™t worry about getting credit, just make this place awesome.
