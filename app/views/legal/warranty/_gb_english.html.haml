    %strong> What is Covered
    \. ChefSteps warrants the Joule Circulator and the Joule Big Clamp (the “Product”) against defects in materials and workmanship under ordinary consumer use for one year from the date of original retail purchase. This Limited
    Warranty applies only to the first consumer owner, unless you have received our written consent that you may transfer it to a subsequent owner. During this warranty period, if a defect arises in the Product, and you follow the instructions for returning
    the Product, we will, at our option, either () repair it using new or refurbished parts, or (ii) replace it with a new or refurbished Product. We recognize that many of our customers are buying the Product well before it ships. If your Product ships
    to you more than 7 days after your purchase date, we will treat the shipment date as the purchase date for purposes of this Limited Warranty.
  %p
    This Limited Warranty applies to any repair, replacement part, or replacement Product for the remainder of the original warranty period or for ninety (90) days, whichever is longer. Any parts or Products that we replace will become our property and you
    will own the replaced parts or Products.
  %p
    %strong> What is Not Covered
    \. This Limited Warranty does not cover damage caused by normal wear and tear, power surges, accidents, misuse (including failure to follow Product documentation and plugging the Product into the wrong type of port),
    neglect, disassembly, alterations, external causes such as extreme thermal or environmental conditions, or commercial use. This Limited Warranty applies only to Products used in the United Kingdom. Using the Product outside the United Kingdom voids
    Limited Warranty.
  %p
    This Limited Warranty does not apply to any software or application, even if packaged or sold with the Product or necessary to operate the Product. Please refer to the End User License Agreement accompanying the software or application for details of
    your rights with respect to its use. ChefSteps does not warrant that the software or application that controls the Product will be uninterrupted or error-free.
  %p
    No employee or representative of ChefSteps or any third party is authorized to modify, extend, or add to this Limited Warranty. If any term of this Limited Warranty is held to be illegal or unenforceable, the remaining terms will remain in full force
    and effect.

    %strong> How to Obtain Warranty Service

    may also be required to provide a purchase receipt or other proof of purchase date.
  %p
    If ChefSteps determines that your Product is eligible for replacement or repair, we may send you prepaid waybills and, if applicable, packaging material so that you can ship the Product in accordance with our shipping instructions. We will return either
    the repaired or replacement Product to you. Provided the Product is eligible for a remedy under this Limited Warranty, ChefSteps will pay for shipping to and from your location if all instructions are followed. Except as set out in the Returns and Refunds
    section of our Terms, you are responsible for all shipping costs if the Product is not eligible for a warranty remedy.
  %p
    ChefSteps may require a credit card authorization as security for shipping costs or the retail price of the replacement Product. If your Product is not eligible for warranty service, or you fail to return a Product for which we ship you a replacement,
    we may charge you the full shipping costs or retail cost of the replacement Product.

    %strong> Your Statutory and other Legal Rights
    \. This Limited Warranty is in addition to, and does not affect, your legal rights and remedies including under statute and our Terms.
