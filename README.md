# Development

To set up a new machine:


## Required

- install homebrew (brew.sh)
- `brew doctor`
- `brew install phantomjs`
- `brew install postgres`
   - set postgres to open at login per output of previous cmd
   - it'll be something like, `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist`
- `echo 'location' > ~/.curlc`
- rails ready install (github.com/joshfng/railsready)
   -  `curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshfng/railsready/master/railsready.sh && bash railsready.sh`
- close your shell and reopen it
- restart your machine if postgres is not running (eg: first install)
- `git clone https://github.com/ChefSteps/ChefSteps.git`
- `cd ChefSteps`
- install latest Xcode
- launch Xcode once
- `xcode-select --install`
- `rvm install ruby 1.9.3` (the version our Gemfile calls for, --with-gcc=clang may be required)
- `gem install bundle` (if this seg faults, try ```rvm reinstall ruby-1.9.3 --with-gcc=clang```
- `bundle`
- `createuser -l -s -r delve`
- `rake db:create`
- install heroku toolbelt (toolbelt.heroku.com)
- rake copy_production_db (youâ€™ll need your heroku acct/passwd and say yes to creating a new public key)
- rails s

## Testing

- `:> rake db:test:prepare` will create the database that the tests will run
   against
- `:> guard` will watch for changes in files and automatically run the tests.

## Personal / Optional

- install Chrome or other preferred browser
- install iterm2 or other shell
- install sublime text 3 or other text editor

# Dan's Notes on E2E testing
To perform E2E testing on angular you need to have node.js installed if you don't already.  You will also need the Karma test runner installed, as well as the ng-scenario and coffee-preprocessor plugins for karma.  You can install them with the following commands:
```bash
brew install nodejs
npm install -g karma
npm install -g karma-ng-scenario
npm install -g karma-coffee-preprocessor
npm install -g karma-cli
npm install -g karma-chrome-launcher
createdb delve_angular
```

Once they are installed you can run the command:
```
script/e2e
```

This will start the server.  It will automatically watch all files in the spec/javascripts/e2e folder and run the tests when you save a file.

# Testing account creation
To succesfully test account creation redis needs to be running to handle the job being enqueued.
```
brew install redis
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist
```

Then go into your chefsteps directory and do
```
rake resque:work QUEUE='*'
```

To setup stripe webhooks
```
brew install ngrok
ngrok 3000
Copy the Forwarding line http://[RANDOM].ngrok.com
Login to stripe
Click ChefSteps in the upper right corner
Webhooks
Add Endpoint
